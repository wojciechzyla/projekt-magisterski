# Virtual Tourist Office System

This application was created as part of my master's thesis. Its purpose is to generate a personalized travel plan for the city of Krak√≥w in Poland. The selection of points of interest is based on the textual description of travel desires provided by the tourist.

## Running the project

Starting the system requires an installed Docker platform (https://www.docker.com/) and 
your own OpenAI API account (https://openai.com/index/openai-api) along with a key.

In addition to the application code, the repository contains the following files:
- .env - configuration file
- embeddings.json
- pois.json
- categories.json
- docker-compose.yaml

In the `.env` file, you need to fill in the following variables:
- for the `OPENAI_API_KEY` variable, provide your OpenAI API key
- for the `EMBEDDINGS_LOADER_SOURCE_FILE_PATH` variable, provide the absolute path to the `embeddings.json` file
- for the `POIS_FILE_PATH` variable, provide the absolute path to the `pois.json` file
- for the `CATEGORIES_FILE_PATH` variable, provide the absolute path to the `categories.json` file

After filling in the `.env` file, run the following command inside the repository:

```commandline
docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml up
```

Two containers, mongo_loader and embeddings_loader, will be in the Exited state after a few seconds. This is normal
and desired behavior. When the flask_app container starts, enter the address 0.0.0.0:5000 in your browser. The first
query execution in the application takes a bit more time. Each subsequent one is faster.
